Instructions to build jar:

Add the gremlin-core jar and gremlin-groovy ja to IntelliJ as compile time
dependencies. From the distribution of Solr that you are using, include the
jars for solr-core, solr-solrj and lucene-core as provided dependencies.

Create an artifact (Project Structure>Artifacts) that will include the
gremlin-core and gremlin-groovy jars.

Copy the created jar to the solr/example/solr/collection1/lib directory.

Edit the solrconf.xml in the solr/example/solr/collection1/conf directory to
include the following lines:

     <queryParser
     name="GremlinQueryFilter"
     class="GremlinQueryParserPlugin"/>
